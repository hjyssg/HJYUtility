pycat
=====

a small python terminal utility to "cat", print, txt and docx files. 

This app uses linux commands inside. 
But you can use it on Windows by Cygwin. 


How to use:  

    python pycat.py [-s] [txt_or_docx_file...]  
    -s flag: sorted outpt 
    wildcard "*" is supported for file names 
    
How to save output into a text file:  

    Type the command by following "> the_file_you_want_to_write.txt".
    
Actually, this is a shell problem.You can refer to [Bash output rediction](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html)
